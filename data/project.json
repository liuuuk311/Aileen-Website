        "description": "I made this video for NIOZ's outreach to show how the WATLAS team performs fieldwork on Griend to investigate where red knots go and how long they stay in the Wadden Sea on their migratory journeys. This information will reveal what areas are critical to shorebirds and why."

        "description": "In this video, you can see how I investigated the use of social information by captive red knots, examining their foraging behaviour both alone and in the group. With this aim, I conducted more than 300 behavioural assays in the experimental shorebird facility at NIOZ, on the island of Texel."

        "description": "I was delighted to be part of the Big Bang Digital, a free 3-day event that aimed at inspiring students to redefine the future and change the world with STEM! In this video I show my work with red knots, describing why studying them is important and how I ended up working with these animals. I hope it will inspire youngsters in their future career in science."
